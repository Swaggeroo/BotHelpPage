            <p>This command creates a new textchannel in which the minigame will take place.
            The minigame is decided by the provided index. Further instructions on how to play
             are displayed in the channel.</p>

            <p>By default only the game-creator (and the admin) can write in the created game-
            textchannel. The game-creator has to invite other users so that they can write.
            He can do this with the >inv-command. >inv @[user] invites one specific user while
            >inv everyone invites every user on the server.</p>

            <p>With this command the game-creator (or an moderator) can delete the game-
            textchannel and delete the all data of the game from our DB. To keep a nice and clean DC-Server
            and to sop our DB from breaking, we want everyone to use this command to clean up after yourself.</p>

            <h3>>Galgenm채nnchen (>creategame 1)</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 1 you can find our first minigame "Galgenm채nnchen".
            I think everybody knows the game, so I will only be covering the commands.
            At the beginning the game-creator has to choose a word and send it to the
            bot with the >ga-command. The game starts as soon as the word is chosen and was successfully
            received by the bot. The word is compared to our blacklist of curse-words, so don't even try to use one.
            <br>
            The players can guess simply by typing >[letter]. It always counts the first letter
            that is typed after the prefix >, ignoring the rest of the message. You can guess the
            whole word with the >word-command. <br>
            To start a new game, you have to delete the old textchannel and then create a new
            one with the >creategame 1-command.<br>
           <b>Don't forget to clean up after yourself with the >deletegame-command. In this minigame it
              ,it is more important than in the other minigames, because you can only be the game-creator for one game at a time!</b>
           </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>Speedtyping (>creategame 2)</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 2 you can find our second minigame "Speedtyping".
                In this game you can compare your typingspeed with your friends. The first one to
                fully replicate the randomly-generated word-message of the bot wins.
                At the beginning the game-creator has to set the amount of words you want to type with the >set [amount]-command.
                The min is 20 words and the max is 200 words.<br>After that, the game-creator has to start
                the game. That is the moment the timer to count your words per minute starts.
                The first one to complete the message wins. After that you can always start a
                new game with the >start-command or rearrange the length with the >set [amount]-command.<br>
                Hint: Copying the message doesn't work ;) ;P<br>

            <h3>>Tic-Tac-Toe (>creategame 3)</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 3 you can find our third minigame "Tic-Tac-Toe".
                I think everybody knows the game, so I will only cover the commands. <br>
                Before the game can start, the game-creator has to assign a second player (his opponent)
                with the >spieler2 [@user]-command. After that he has to use the >start-command to start the game.
                (Don't forget to >inv [@user] the second player, so he is able to write)<br>
                After the game, you can start a new one by using the >start-command again. You can also always change
                the second player with the >spieler2 [@user]-command, after a game has ended.<br>
                <b>Don't forget to clean up after yourself with the >deletegame-command</b>

            <h3>>Sch채tzen (>creategame 4)</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 4 you can find our fourth minigame "Sch채tzen".
               In this game you will guess the answer to randomly-generated questions and the one who is the closest to the answer wins a point.<br>
               At the beginning the game-creator has to add his opponents with the >add [@user]-command (Don't forget to also >inv [@user] them, so they
               have the permission to write in the gamechannel). <br>
               After that you are ready to play. Just type >next and the next question will appear. (Sorry if they repeat fast, at thsi moment (04:53 10.04.2021),
               there are only about 100 Questions in total). This command can be used infinitely. If two or more user have the same answer, all of them get a point.
               With the >points you can see how many rounds each player has won. <br>
               <b>Don't forget to clean up after yourself with the >deletegame-command</b>

            <h3>>Schiffe versenken (>creategame 5)</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 5 you can find our fifth minigame "Schiffe versenken".
               I think everybody knows how to play this game, so I will only cover the commands.<br>
               At the beginning the game-creator first has to assign his opponent with the >add [@user]-command. Then both player have to
               place their ships. Both of you have 1 5-piece ship, 2 4-piece ships, 3 3-piece ships and 4 2-piece ships. How to place them is
               explained in the initial message which is also asking you to place them.<br>
               After both players have finished placing their ships, a message is send to their game-textchannel telling you that you are ready to start.
               You guess by using the >[position]-command (AS EXAMPLE: >B5 for "shooting" the position B5). <br>
               To play another round, after the first one, you have to create a new game.
