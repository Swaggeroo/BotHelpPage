             everyone who is in the same voice-channel as the command writer for 10 seconds
            (the command writer does not get muted, so for 10 seconds you can talk without getting interrupted)</p>

            <p>This command returns an overview over all available minigames with it's specific index.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>creategame [index]</h3>
            <p>This command creates a new textchannel in which the minigame will take place.
            The minigame is decided by the provided index. Further instructions on how to play
             are displayed in the channel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>inv @[user] && >inv everyone</h3>
            <p>By default only the game-creator (and the admin) can write in the created game-
            textchannel. The game-creator has to invite other users so that they can write.
            He can do this with the >inv-command. >inv @[user] invites one specific user while
            >inv everyone invites every user on the server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>:mop:</h3>
            <p>This command can only be used in a game-textchannel. It clears all previously
            existing messages in the channel (GetMop(p)ed).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>deletegame</h3>
            <p>With this command the game-creator (or an moderator) can delete the game-
            textchannel and delete the all data of the game from our DB. To keep a nice and clean DC-Server
            and to sop our DB from breaking, we want everyone to use this command to clean up after yourself.</p>

    <div class="flex-container column title" id="avaGames">
        <h2>Available Games</h2>
        <div class="flex-container column element">
            <h3>>Galgenmännchen</h3>
            <p>Under >creategame 1 you can find our first minigame "Galgenmännchen".
            I think everybody knows the game, so I will only be covering the commands.
            At the beginning the game-creator has to choose a word and send it to the
            bot with the >ga-command. The game starts as soon as the word is chosen and was successfully
            received by the bot. The word is compared to our blacklist of curse-words, so don't even try to use one.
            </p>
            <p>The players can guess simply by typing >[letter]. It always counts the first letter
            that is typed after the prefix >, ignoring the rest of the message. You can guess the
            whole word with the >word-command. <br>
            To start a new game, you have to delete the old textchannel and then create a new
            one with the >creategame 1-command</p>
